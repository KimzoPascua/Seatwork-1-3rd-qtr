<p>Modern Family follows three different types of families (nuclear, blended, and same-sex) who live in the Los Angeles area and are linked by wealthy business owner Jay Pritchett and his children, Claire and Mitchell.

Patriarch Jay remarried Gloria Delgado Pritchett , a passionate Colombian immigrant, with whom he has a young son, Fulgencio Joseph "Joe" Pritchett  which is born in the middle of the fourth season, and a son from Gloria's previous marriage, Manuel Manny Delgado. Jay's ex-wife DeDe and Gloria's ex-husband Javier both appear on the show on occasion.

Claire, Jay's daughter, was a stay-at-home mom who returned to the business world (at the start of the fifth season), eventually becoming the CEO of her father's company, Pritchett's Closets and Blinds (in the middle of the seventh season). Phil Dunphy, a realtor and self-proclaimed "cool dad" who is also an amateur magician, is her husband. They have three children: Haley, a stereotypically ditzy adolescent girl; Alex, an intelligent and nerdy middle child; and Luke, the oddball only son.</p>

				<p>Phil is a fun dad Phil explains himself as a "cool dad." He is a dedicated family man who adores his wife Claire and is constantly looking for ways to bond with his three children, which often falls short. He employs a parenting technique he calls "peerenting," which consists of speaking like a peer while acting like a parent ("Pilot"). Phil is generally portrayed as a good person who always takes the high road when dealing with problems, except when pushed too far, as in "Fulgencio," where he resorts to mafia-like methods to solve his family's problems. Phil is frequently obsessed with being his children's best friend, which falls short, especially as they enter puberty.

				Phil is portrayed as a funny guy, which he claims began at his 12th birthday party, when everyone laughed at his joke and he realized he was funny. He frequently uses wordplay and improvisation in sentences to amuse people. For example, when before he answers the phone, he once asks "Who sang Evil Woman?" and then answers the phone "E-L-O" as in 'Hello'.</p>

				<h3>Phil Dunphy</h3>

				<p>When it comes to dealing with her family, CLaire is a perfectionist, often knowing what to do better than her husband Phil. She is uptight and "bossy" about getting things done around the house, which usually results in amusing disagreements with the laid-back Phil, who adores her. Her daughters claim she has excellent hearing because she can hear them when they complain about being bored ("Aunt Mommy"). She is also involved in her children's school and assists in arranging events, but she has been described as tactless and unlikable. In any case, Mitchell and Cameron frequently seek her advice on parenting while raising Lily.

				She has a habit of being controlling, arrogant, abrasive and hostile, which Mitchell attributes to the fact that she couldn't control the chaos in her own home</p>

				<p>Haley is remembered by her family as the pretty girl in the family, and most of her interests and advantages revolve around that, despite the fact that she is shy, ugly, and a troublemaker who never watches Too Much TV Time.

                One recurring theme with Haley is that she appears to share a lot of Claire's personality when she was a rebellious adolescent, even describing their mothers as "control freaks." This frustrates Claire, who admits that she doesn't want her children to make the same mistakes she did.

                Haley is portrayed as slow and ditzy, frequently needing to take her time to get jokes. Alex constantly mocks and condescends to her for her lack of intelligence. It is also the catalyst for her becoming surprisingly self-critical, as she later admits that she is aware of her stupidity and is deeply affected by her family's mockery and derision of her as a failure.</p>

				<h3>Hayley Dunphy</h3>

			<p>Despite being younger than the majority of her family, Alex is arguably the most intelligent and well-read, even more so than Manny and her lawyer uncle, Mitchell ("Other People's Children"). She addresses people with sarcasm and condescension because she is an overachiever, but most of the time, no one understands her humor. She is also shown to be competitive, much like her mother, Claire, which she admits is due to her habit of finishing first. She takes much more pride in her schoolwork than Haley or Luke, and she rarely has meltdowns about it — except for once in "Under Pressure," when she rages at her birthday party and after Claire attends an open house and discovers that Alex has to deal with She had 6hours of homework for all of her AP classes combined. "I don't know how you don't have a meltdown every day," Claire said to Alex, prompting Alex to cry and hug her.</p>
